# Numeric-Banlga-Sign language detection using YOLOV8 and fusion of Canny and Sobel edge detection
It's a Final year thesis work. Topic: Numerical Sign language Detection and Recognition for Human-Computer interaction. Here, generated Canny and Sobel fusion edge maps of sign images and trained those using YOLOv8.
First, run the edge_fusion.ipynb file using data.yaml annotated numeric sign image data
Second, run the SL_detection.ipynb file using edge fusion images.
